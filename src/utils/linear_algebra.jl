Parallel implementation of a for loop that modifies array `v` in-place.

Computes the element-wise product of three vectors `u`, `v`, and `w` and sums the results.
This is equivalent to the mathematical operation `∑ᵢ uᵢ * vᵢ * wᵢ`. It is used as an
optimized implementation for the weighted inner product of vectors.

The `@fastmath` macro allows for aggressive floating-point optimizations, and `@simd`
instructs the compiler to vectorize the loop if possible.
